# Data Structure - Review/Studying

## Description
Most developers lack the knowledge of data structures in our day to day routine. The usage of arrays is predominant. Even though I know that is very convinient to use arrays, it is also important to understand what would be the best approach to store data in a given situation. A good example would be keep unique users in an array coming from a query in a database, you can use Set to eliminate duplicate users instead of storing in an array an performing a linear search with a for/loop. 

## Goal
My goal with this repository is to keep studying in order to improve my skills allowing me to a better professional.

## Language
Although I'm much more confortable using Javascript, I'm coding data structure example in Python because it is very readable, no heavy syntax and easy to started of.
